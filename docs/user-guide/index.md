# User Guide

Welcome to the CoreRec User Guide. These guides are task-based, meaning they focus on helping you achieve a specific goal rather than just listing available classes.

## Getting Started Paths

*   **I have a CSV file**: Start with [**Data Preparation**](data-preparation.md).
*   **I have no user history**: Check out the [**Cold Start Guide**](../advanced/cold-start.md).
*   **I want to see the graph**: Jump to [**Visualization**](../utilities/visualization.md).
