Transformer Based Unionized Filtering Base Class

Base implementation of transformer architecture for unionized filtering recommendations.
Provides core transformer components including self-attention, feed-forward networks,
and positional encodings.

Features:
    - Multi-head self-attention layers
    - Position-wise feed-forward networks
    - Layer normalization
    - Residual connections
    - Positional encoding integration
