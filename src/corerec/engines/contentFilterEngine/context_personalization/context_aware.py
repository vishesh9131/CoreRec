class ContextAwareRecommender:
    """
    A context-aware recommender system that adapts recommendations based on contextual factors.
    
    This recommender system incorporates contextual information to provide more relevant 
    recommendations by adjusting feature weights based on the current context. It considers
    various contextual factors such as time, location, user state, and other environmental 
    variables to modify the importance of different item features.
    
    Attributes:
        context_factors (Dict[str, Dict]): Mapping of context factors to their value-specific weights.

        update_context: Updates the current context and recalculates feature weights.
        recommend: Generates recommendations considering the current context.
        _initialize_feature_weights: Initializes weights based on context.
