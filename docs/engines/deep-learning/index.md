# Deep Learning Models

This section covers state-of-the-art deep learning architectures for recommendation, including multi-task learning, sequential modeling, and graph neural networks.

## DCN (Deep & Cross Network)
Efficiently learns feature interactions of bounded degrees.

::: corerec.engines.dcn.DCN
    options:
      show_root_heading: true
      show_source: true

## DeepFM
Combines the power of factorization machines for recommendation and deep learning for feature learning.

::: corerec.engines.deepfm.DeepFM
    options:
      show_root_heading: true
      show_source: true

## GNNRec (Graph Neural Network)
Applies Graph Neural Networks to the user-item graph.

::: corerec.engines.gnnrec.GNNRec
    options:
      show_root_heading: true
      show_source: true

## MIND (Multi-Interest Network with Dynamic Routing)
Captures diverse user interests using dynamic routing.

::: corerec.engines.mind.MIND
    options:
      show_root_heading: true
      show_source: true

## NASRec (Neural Architecture Search)
Automatically searches for the best recommendation architecture.

::: corerec.engines.nasrec.NASRec
    options:
      show_root_heading: true
