    GraphFiltering Class

    This class implements graph-based filtering techniques for recommendation systems.
    Graph-based filtering leverages the structure of a graph to make recommendations by
    analyzing the relationships between users and items.

    Attributes:
        graph (Graph): The graph structure representing users and items.
        similarity_metric (str): The metric used to calculate similarity between nodes.
        damping_factor (float): The damping factor used in algorithms like PageRank.
        max_iterations (int): Maximum number of iterations for convergence in iterative algorithms.

    Methods:
        build_graph(data):
            Constructs the graph from the given data, where nodes represent users and items,
            and edges represent interactions or similarities.

        compute_similarity():
            Computes similarity scores between nodes using the specified similarity metric.

        recommend(user_id, top_n=10):
            Generates top-N recommendations for a given user by analyzing the graph structure.

        update_graph(new_data):
            Updates the graph with new interactions or changes in the data, allowing for
            dynamic recommendations.
